## SQL CRUD Statements

* I performed CRUD through a Windows Form Application built in Visual Studios. This form also includes a sample layout for how users will sign up for our application. This will be a form based system based on a website. The following file is the actual SQLite database that was created and used for this sample.

*** You will need to download this DB and view it externally. ***
