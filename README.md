CS665 Project 1 README

* This repo is for my Introduction to Database Systems class Project 1.

* In this project, I am incorporting my Senior Design Project, an application called Roomers, to build a database. While this application will require an extensive database with many tables, I am limiting this project to only the Roommates, Landlords, Login, and Signup tables to ensure I make the deadline for project 1.
